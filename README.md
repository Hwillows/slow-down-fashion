y# slow-down-fashion

Run 'NPM start' to run the back end in the terminal

Be aware I am running the backend on port 5005

Open a new terminal and run 'CD client' then 'NPM start' to run the front end

The database is called 'slowDownFashion' in mySQL

I currently have 1 table in my database called "Wardrobe"

Wardrobe table consists of 3 headings:
id: int - this is auto incremented
clothesCategory: varChar(255) - this information is added to the database in the drop down box
clothesImage: varChar(255) - this currently takes in a URL. But I would like to change this to blob eventually
